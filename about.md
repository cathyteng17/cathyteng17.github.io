		<p>I am interested in the environment, website/application interface design, human-computer interaction, and computational biology. I swim in my spare time and try to ignore my shin splints when I go for runs. I love classic movies and anything to do with period dramas. I love listening to K-pop and will eat most non-spicy foods. I played the piano seriously for 8 years and still dabble in it. I'm attempting to pick up the ukulele during quarantine. And I love sweets.</p>
