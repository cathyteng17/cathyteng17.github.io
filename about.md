		<h3>Interests</h3>
		<p>I am passionate about the environment and website/application interface design. I swim in my spare time and try to ignore my shin splints when I go for runs. I love classic movies and anything to do with period pieces. I also seriously listen to K-pop and eat almost all non-spicy foods. I used to consider getting a minor in piano performance but then abruptly retired that idea my freshman year of high school. I have an unending stomach and am probably eating a (healthy) snack right now. Pray for my wallet.</p>
